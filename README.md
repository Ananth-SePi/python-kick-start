# Python Kick Start

This project used to help the beginners of python in setting up the project and understanding the basic data types, data structure, control statement, 
classes, exception handling etc.

### Set up python project

1. Download python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. It would be better to use IDE (Integral Development Environment), it's a tool to create and run the code. Here, I use [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
3. Open the IDE and create a project.
